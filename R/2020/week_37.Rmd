# Tidy Tuesday week 37

This is my very first submission to Tidy Tuesday! Pretty excited I got to explore a sitcom I basically grew up with!

## Get data

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 37)
```
## Explore
```{r}
library(dplyr)
tuesdata$friends %>% glimpse()
tuesdata$friends %>% summary()
tuesdata$friends_info %>% glimpse()
tuesdata$friends_emotions %>% glimpse()
```

```{r}
tuesdata$friends %>% 
  group_by(speaker, season, episode) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  top_n(6)
```

```{r}
tuesdata$friends %>% filter(season == 9, episode == 1, scene == 1) %>% select(text, speaker, utterance) %>% top_n(15, utterance)
```
