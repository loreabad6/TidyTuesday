# Tidy Tuesday week 37

This is my very first submission to Tidy Tuesday! Pretty excited I got to explore a sitcom I basically grew up with!

## Get data

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 37)
```
## Explore
```{r}
library(dplyr)
tuesdata$friends %>% glimpse()
tuesdata$friends %>% summary()
tuesdata$friends_info %>% glimpse()
tuesdata$friends_emotions %>% glimpse()
```

```{r}
speakers = tuesdata$friends %>% 
  filter(speaker != 'Scene Directions') %>% 
  group_by(speaker, season, episode) %>% 
  summarize(no_of_lines = n()) 
```

```{r}
speakers %>% group_by(speaker) %>% 
  summarise(no_of_lines = sum(no_of_lines)) %>% 
  top_n(6, no_of_lines)
```

```{r}

## I thought I would do some network viz with ggraph using some of the analysis ceros already made
