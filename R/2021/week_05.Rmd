# Tidy Tuesday week 5

For this week, I present an step by step of my submission, going through data preparation and visualization. In particular, I used a custom `ggraph` layout based on geographic coordinate reference systems to combine `sfnetwork` objects with spatially implicit edges (without spatial geometries) from the [`sfnetworks`](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/) package with other `ggplot2` functions.

## Libraries

Let's start with loading the libraries we will use:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(dplyr, quietly = T)
library(tidygeocoder)
library(sf, quietly = T)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(tidygraph, quietly = T)
# remotes::install_github("luukvdmeer/sfnetworks")
library(sfnetworks)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggraph)
library(stringi)
library(ggtext)
```

## Data

The data for [this week](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/readme.md) is from the ["Break Free from Plastic"](https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/) initiative.

In the data, information regarding plastic recollection campaigns in several countries around the world from 2019 and 2020 is categorized by plastic type and by parent company which counts how many times a plastic item coming from that particular company was collected. We can take a look at the data structure and main variables here:

```{r, echo = F, cache = T}
tuesdata = tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 5)
```

```{r}
tuesdata$plastics %>% glimpse()
```

## Idea and data wrangling

An interesting opportunity to create a spatial graph structure from this data is to generate a connected network between those countries where plastics have been collected and the parent companies headquarters. To avoid making a cluttered graph, we can analyze the **Top 5** polluting parent companies.

### Preparing the data

First, we tidy the entries for parent companies, removing `Unbranded`, `null`s and the `Grand Total`s per year. Also for countries, we remove the `EMPTY` fields and harmonize country names with capitalized letters.

```{r}
plastics = tuesdata$plastics %>% 
  filter(
    !(parent_company %in% c("Grand Total", "null", "Null", "Unbranded")), 
    country != "EMPTY"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    parent_company = parent_company %>% 
      tolower() %>% 
      stri_trans_general("Latin-ASCII") %>% 
      stri_trans_totitle(),
    country = stri_trans_totitle(country)
  ) 
```

Now we can query which were the top five polluters for the 2019 and 2020 campaigns.

```{r}
top_Co = plastics %>% 
  group_by(parent_company) %>% 
  summarise(
    country_count = n_distinct(country), 
    grand_total_sum = sum(grand_total, na.rm = T)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(country_count, grand_total_sum)) %>% 
  head(5)

knitr::kable(top_Co)
```

These five companies will become our `from` nodes in the network structure we will create later.

To create our `to` nodes, we will look at those countries that were affected with the plastic pollution originally coming from these companies.

```{r}
countries = plastics %>% 
  filter(parent_company %in% top_Co$parent_company) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(no_of_brands = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(no_of_brands))

## Let's have a glimpse at it!
knitr::kable(head(countries, 5))
```

**BUT**, we want to create a spatial network, so we need to locate these nodes in space!

### Making it spatial!

#### From nodes

Let's start with our `from` nodes. I could not really find a good way to query automatically the headquarter locations of these companies (suggestions welcome!), so this was a manual process. I looked into this [crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/companies-search-with-headquarters) and searched for each parent company in my `top_Co` list. I copied the addresses below:

```{r}
hq = c(
  "Atlanta, Georgia, United States", #Coca-Cola
  "New York, New York, United States", #PepsiCo
  "Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland", #Nestle
  "Mclean, Virginia, United States", #Mars
  "London, England, United Kingdom" #Unilever
)
```

Now, we can make use of some nice geocoding packages to get a point location for these addresses. I have chosen to use `tidygeocoder` for this case. I query from OSM and get a nice `data.frame` with the address, the latitude and the longitude values.

```{r, eval = F}
coords = geo(hq, method = "osm")
```

```{r, include = F}
# To avoid calling the geocoder on each knit
coords = structure(list(address = c("Atlanta, Georgia, United States", 
"New York, New York, United States", "Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland", 
"Mclean, Virginia, United States", "London, England, United Kingdom"), lat = c(33.7489924, 40.7127281, 46.4602978, 38.9342888, 51.5073219), long = c(-84.3902644, -74.0060152, 6.8418655, -77.1776327, -0.1276474)), row.names = c(NA, -5L), class = c("tbl_df", 
"tbl", "data.frame"))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(coords)
```

I can now combine this `data.frame` with the `top_Co` object I created before. I will add the longitude and latitude columns to my data, and convert into an `sf` object with these coordinates. Note that the results from the geocoding process are in `CRS = 4326`. We will add a type column to clearly identify this as "Parent Company" nodes. 

```{r}
top_parent_companies = top_Co %>% 
  mutate(hq = hq, lat = coords$lat, long = coords$long) %>% 
  st_as_sf(crs = 4326, coords = c("long", "lat")) %>% 
  select(name = parent_company) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Parent Company")

top_parent_companies
```

#### To nodes

Now let's take a look at our `to` nodes. This will be made out of those countries where the plastics were found. We can find their coordinates (probably their centroids, depends on OSM) using the `tidygeocoder::geo()` function.

```{r, eval = F}
coords_countries = geo(countries$country, method = "osm")
# Get Taiwan coordinates, which was not recognized
coords_taiwan = geo("Taiwan", method = "osm")
coords_country = coords_countries %>% 
  mutate(
    lat = ifelse(address == "Taiwan_ Republic Of China (Roc)", coords_taiwan$lat, lat),
    long = ifelse(address == "Taiwan_ Republic Of China (Roc)", coords_taiwan$long, long)
) 
```

```{r, include = F}
coords_country = structure(list(address = c("Argentina", "Australia", "Bangladesh", "Benin", "Brazil", "Bulgaria", "Burkina Faso", "Cameroon", "Canada", "Chile", "China", "Colombia", "Cyprus", "Denmark", "Ecuador", "El Salvador", "Empty", "France", "Germany", "Ghana", "Greece", "Honduras", "Hong Kong", "India", "Indonesia", "Ireland", "Italy", "Japan", "Kenya", "Korea", "Kuwait", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Malaysia", "Maldives", "Mexico", "Montenegro", "Netherlands", "Nigeria", "Peru", "Philippines", "Portugal", "Romania", "Rwanda", "Serbia", "Singapore", "Slovenia", "South Africa", "Spain", "Sri Lanka", "Switzerland", "Taiwan_ Republic Of China (Roc)", "Tanzania", "Thailand", "Togo", "Tunisia", "Turkey", "Ukraine", "United Kingdom Of Great Britain & Northern Ireland", "United States Of America", "Vietnam"), lat = c(-34.9964963, -24.7761086, 24.4768783, 9.5293472, -10.3333333, 42.6073975, 12.0753083, 4.6125522, 61.0666922, -31.7613365, 35.000074, 2.8894434, 34.9823018, 55.670249, -1.3397668, 13.8000382, 39.74962805, 46.603354, 
51.0834196, 8.0300284, 38.9953683, 15.2572432, 22.2793278, 22.3511148, -2.4833826, 52.865196, 42.6384261, 36.5748441, 1.4419683, 36.638392, 29.2733964, 56.8406494, 55.3500003, 4.5693754, 4.7064352, 22.5000485, 42.9868853, 52.24764975, 9.6000359, -6.8699697, 12.7503486, 40.0332629, 45.9852129, -1.9646631, 44.1534121, 1.357107, 46.14903455, -28.8166236, 39.3260685, 7.5554942, 46.7985624, 23.9739374, -6.5247123, 14.8971921, 8.7800265, 33.8439408, 38.9597594, 49.4871968, 54.7023545, 39.7837304, 13.2904027), long = c(-64.9672817, 134.755, 90.2932426, 2.2584408, -53.2, 25.4856617, -1.6880314, 13.1535811, -107.9917071, -71.3187697, 104.999927, -73.783892, 33.1451285, 10.3333283, -79.3666965, -88.9140683, -104.946658106006, 1.8883335, 10.4234469, -1.0800271, 21.9877132, -86.0755145, 114.1628131, 78.6677428, 117.8902853, -7.9794599, 12.674297, 139.2394179, 38.4313975, 127.6961188, 47.4979476, 24.7537645, 23.7499997, 102.2656823, 73.3287853, -100.0000375, 19.5180992, 5.54124684940616, 7.9999721, -75.0458515, 122.7312101, -7.8896263, 24.6859225, 30.0644358, 20.55144, 103.8194992, 14.6263257533406, 24.991639, -4.8379791, 80.7137847, 8.2319736, 120.9820179, 35.7878438, 100.83273, 1.0199765, 9.400138, 34.9249653, 31.2718321, -3.2765753, -100.4458825, 108.4265113)), row.names = c(NA, -61L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))

```

And last but not least, we convert it to an `sf` object, giving it a type "Affected Country" for differentiation.

```{r}
affected_countries = countries %>% 
  left_join(coords_country, by = c("country" = "address")) %>% 
  st_as_sf(crs = 4326, coords = c("long", "lat")) %>% 
  select(name = country) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Affected Country")

affected_countries
```

### Preparing the graph structure

So maybe you already picked it up but to make it clear: a graph structure requires two elements "nodes" and "edges". Nodes are the interacting elements and the edges are how these elements are connected to each other. 

We can now create our node list with the countries and parent companies coordinates. For this we will bind both datasets together, since they have the same column names!

```{r}
nodes = rbind(top_parent_companies, affected_countries)
```

To create our edges, we will go back to our original plastics data. We filter the parent companies and the countries according to our previous analyses. To make a proper edge table, we will rename the `parent_company` column as `from` and the `country` column as `to`. 

```{r}
edges = plastics %>% 
  filter(
    parent_company %in% top_Co$parent_company,
    country %in% countries$country
  ) %>% 
  select(from = parent_company, to = country, everything()) 
```

And finally, we can build our spatial network using the sfnetworks package. We pass the nodes and the edges to the building function `sfnetwork()`. You will see now that our nodes and edges are combined into one single `sfnetwork` object.

```{r}
net = sfnetwork(nodes, edges)
net
```

### Background data and final wrangling

We will now get some background data, which in this case will be the world countries, obtained with the package `rnaturalearth`. We will transform the projection to one that does not distort so much the country sizes. I have chosen Winkel Tripel.

```{r}
world = ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = "+proj=wintri +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +over")
```

We will need to project our network as well, which can be done with the same function as above. 

```{r}
net = net %>% 
  st_transform(crs = "+proj=wintri +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +over")
```

#### Network simplification

One interesting thing to note is that we have repeated edges going from the same parent company to the same country. Here we can filter the network to show this. From our process to construct the network, we know that the first 5 nodes are for the parent companies, and the rest for affected countries, so we can filter as follows:

```{r}
net %>% 
  activate("edges") %>% 
  filter(edge_is_between(1, 6))
```

This repetition is because we have data for two years. We can summarize the data to get a grand total using a ["spatial morpher"](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/morphers.html) that will simplify these redundant nodes.

```{r}
net = net %>% 
  convert(
    to_spatial_simple, .clean = T, 
    ## This will summarize our attributes by summing them up.
    ## It will ignore the year column from our final output.
    summarise_attributes = list(
      function(x) sum(x, na.rm = T), 
      year = "ignore"
    )
  )

net %>% 
  activate("edges") %>% 
  filter(edge_is_between(1, 6))
```

And now we are ready to create our data visualization!

## Visualizing!

First things first, let's load some fonts (yes, I am a windows user! `r emo::ji("neutral_face")`).

```{r, eval = F}
extrafont::loadfonts(device = 'win')
```

We will now make a match for colors so that a descriptive text prepared below corresponds to the points used in the final map. The color assignment was done with the following named vector, which takes the name of the polluting companies as names for a palette with 5 colors. We will then use this vector in our description text and in the final plot.

```{r}
comp_name = net %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  filter(type == "Parent Company") %>%
  pull(name)

comp_col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Dark2")
names(comp_col) = comp_name
```

Now we can prepare the title, subtitle, caption and a short description to be included in the plot. The text is wrapped around `<span>` tags to pass them to `ggtext` functions later.

```{r, include = F}
# Repeated below just to show nicer on markdown, 
# the labels should have no line breaks!
title = "From **multinationals** to **wasteland countries**"
subtitle = "Insights from the <span style='color:#3a8c9e'>#break<span style='color:#85cbda'>free</span>fromplastic</span> initiative" 
caption = "Data: *Break Free from Plastic* courtesy of Sarah Sauve. Visualization: @loreabad6"
description = paste(
  "Plastics from the **top 5** polluting companies: <span style='color:",
  comp_col[1], "'>Coca-Cola</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[2], "'>Pepsico</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[3], "'>Nestlé</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[4], "'>Mars, Inc.</span> and <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[5], "'>Unilever</span>, have been found in",
  nrow(affected_countries), "different countries between 2019 and 2020. <br>The lines connect the parent companies' headquarters to the countries where their plastics were found. Thicker lines represent higher plastic counts.")
```

```{r, eval = F}
## Check the .Rmd file for a correct way to prepare this labels.
title = "From **multinationals** to **wasteland countries**"
subtitle = "Insights from the 
            <span style='color:#3a8c9e'>
            #break<span style='color:#85cbda'>
            free</span>fromplastic
            </span> initiative" 
caption = "Data: *Break Free from Plastic* courtesy of Sarah Sauvé. 
          Visualization: @loreabad6"
description = paste(
  "Plastics from the **top 5** polluting companies: <span style='color:",
  comp_col[1], "'>Coca-Cola</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[2], "'>Pepsico</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[3], "'>Nestlé</span>, <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[4], "'>Mars, Inc.</span> and <span style='color:", 
  comp_col[5], "'>Unilever</span>, have been found in",
  nrow(affected_countries), "different countries between 2019 and 2020.
  <br>The lines connect the parent companies' headquarters to the
  countries where their plastics were found. Thicker lines represent
  higher plastic counts."
)
```

### Integrating sfnetworks with ggraph

Since sfnetworks subclasses `tbl_graph` objects, we can easily pass them to a ggraph structure. But, to let ggraph know where to place the nodes, we can create a layout function that will extract the graph coordinates.

```{r}
layout_sf = function(graph){
  # Extract X and Y coordinates from the nodes
  graph = activate(graph, "nodes")
  x = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,"X"]
  y = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,"Y"]
  data.frame(x, y)
}
```

### Let's plot already!

And now we can finally work on our visualization! See the comments between each line for explanations of what is going on...

```{r, fig.showtext = T, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 10}
# Start our ggraph, with a layout that calls our layout_sf() function
g = ggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +
  # Plot background with geom_sf
  geom_sf(data = world, fill = "grey30", color = NA) +
  # Create arcs between edges using ggraph
  geom_edge_arc(
    # Alpha and width change according to the plastic grand total count
    aes(alpha = grand_total, width = grand_total),
    # The strength corresponds to how curved the arc is
    color = "white", strength = 0.7, show.legend = F
  ) +
  # Create node geoms using ggraph, in this case points
  geom_node_point(
    # Remember the types we assigned during creation, they will help us 
    # filter which nodes we want to represent with a point and which not.
    # ggraph has a very nice filter aesthetic that let's us do this simple
    aes(fill = name, filter = type == "Parent Company"),
    # I will use pch 21, so the stroke determines the bound to use
    size = 2.5, color = "white", stroke = 1, show.legend = F, shape = 21
  ) +
  # Give colors to each Parent Company
  scale_fill_manual(values = comp_col) +
  # Get the labels created above. They have markdown syntax.
  labs(
    title = title,
    subtitle = subtitle, 
    caption = caption
  ) +
  # Add our description from above
  # Note that X and Y are a trial and error result
  geom_textbox(
    aes(label = description, x = -16011994, y = -4018694), 
    color = "white", size = 2.75, width = grid::unit(0.25, "npc"),
    # remove label background and outline
    fill = NA, box.color = NA, family = "Tahoma", 
    # remove box padding, since we have removed the box outline
    box.padding = grid::unit(rep(0.1, 4), "pt") 
  ) +
  # Adjust the width and alpha limits
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.25, 0.75)) +
  scale_edge_alpha(range = c(0.15, 0.5)) +
  # This is needed to correctly plot Winkel Tripel!
  coord_sf(datum = NULL) +
  # And final touches
  theme(
    text = element_text(color = "white"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey10"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey10"),
    # Pass theme options to ggtext to understand markdown syntax
    plot.title = element_markdown(family = 'Tahoma', size = 14), 
    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(family = 'Tahoma', size = 10), 
    plot.caption = element_markdown(family = 'Tahoma', size = 8)
  )
```

### Save plot and crop white space

This final step for me is always trial and error until getting the best width and height. I use the `here::here()` function to handle paths. The `knitr::plot_crop()` is a really handy function to give the last post-processing to our result.

```{r, eval = F}
ggsave(g, filename = here::here("plot", "2021_week_05.png"), 
       device = "png", width = 20, height = 14, units = "cm")
knitr::plot_crop(here::here("plot", "2021_week_05.png"))
```

## Check out the result!

And voilá! 

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loreabad6/TidyTuesday/master/plot/2021_week_05.png")
```

Hopefully you did not quit half way through this step by step guide and will be now encouraged to test the `sfnetworks` and `ggraph` integration! Leave me any suggestions or comments on the issues of this repo!
