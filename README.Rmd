### Week 05

To create this plot I used the [`sfnetworks`](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/) package in combination with [`ggraph`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/). I am writing an entry that illustrates the first steps of integrating both packages! I will link it here when it is ready!
